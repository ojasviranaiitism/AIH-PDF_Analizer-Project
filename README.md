# Adobe India Hackathon - Round 1B Submission

This project is a persona-driven document intelligence engine. It takes a collection of PDFs, a user persona, and a job-to-be-done, and outputs a ranked list of the most relevant sections and sub-sections to help the user accomplish their task.

The entire solution is packaged in a Docker container for offline, CPU-based execution.
